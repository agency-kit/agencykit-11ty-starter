Leverage the combined efficiency and power of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as your SSG and Notion-as-a-CMS, powered by [NotionCMS](https://www.agencykit.so/notion-cms/guide/).

Define all of your website routes in your Notion database structure as you add content.

So this structure:

![NotionCMS database structure automatically defines your site's routes](/public/database_structure.png)

generates these routes:

```
[
  '/about',
  '/team',
  '/team/jacob',
  '/team/mordecai',
  '/pricing',
  '/posts',
  '/posts/how-to-use-notion-cms',
  '/posts/how-to-build-a-blog-with-notion'
]
```

Each of these paths automatically generate a page with the content on it in 11ty. 

If the path has children, e.g. `team` and `posts` here, that path automatically generates a collection with the child pages in it. So the `team` collection will have `jacob` and `mordecai` pages and the `post` collection will have the posts. 

This holds for any number of levels and is extremely powerful when it comes to building large website hierarchies and using the data in your collection however you need. Oh, did I mention that this happens automatically with no config?

No configuration besides setting 2 variables in `.env` is required to get started, but this is also a great jumping off point for more advanced workflows using NotionCMS plugins and custom 11ty templating and pagination.

## Usage

1. Install the packages.
   ``` npm install ``` (or equivalent).
3. Set up your Notion database ID and API key in `.env`.

   ```
   NOTION_API=your_secret_here
   NOTION_DB_ID=your_db_id_here
   ```
   
   If you've never used Notion API before, you have to set up an integration and get an API key (steps [here](https://www.agencykit.so/notion-cms/quickstart/#create-notion-integration)).

   Then you have to set up a NotionCMS-compatible database to hold your content (you can copy [this one to start](https://cooked-shovel-3c3.notion.site/NotionCMS-Quickstart-Database-Template-719f1f9d1547465d96bcd7e80333c831?pvs=4)) and get to writing.
  
   Don't forget to set `draftMode` true if you haven't published anything. See full list of NotionCMS options [here](https://www.agencykit.so/notion-cms/guide/api/).

4. Run 11ty. ```npm run serve```
